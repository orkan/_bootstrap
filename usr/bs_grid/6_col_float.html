      <p>
        A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of
        the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to
        demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
      </p>

      <p>
        As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image.
        Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather
        than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually
        conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should
        not really be read.
      </p>

      <p>
        And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder
        text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of
        content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
